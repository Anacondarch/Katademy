# A pack contains 4 blue, 2 red and 3 black pens. If 2 pens are drawn at random from the pack, NOT replaced and then another pen is drawn. What is the probability of drawing 2 blue pens and 1 black pen?

# Firstly, we get the sum of all the pen which is equal to 9. first we find the probability of drawing a black pen which is

# In[6]:


#Probability of drawing two blue pen and 1 black pen
(4/9)*(4/9)*(3/9)

# A bag contains blue and red balls. Two balls are drawn randomly without replacement. The probability of selecting a blue and then a red ball is 0.2. The probability of selecting a blue ball in the first draw is 0.5. What is the probability of drawing a red ball, given that the first ball drawn was blue

# Number of balls drawn without replacement=2
# The Probability of selecting a blue and then a red ball is 0.2
# The Probability of selecting a blue ball in the first draw is 0.5
